# Overarching concept of lottery/pot:

-   There is one address that serves as the “pot” or the “treasury”
   
-   This treasury takes 2% of all transactions
    
-   All money “won” by the “casino” also goes to this pot
    
-   When someone buys a ticket, the money also goes to this pot
    

## Lottery odds:
Every week, ⅓ of the pot is given away; users’ chances are as follows:
    

1.  Each person’s chance is proportional to the amount of WC they hold in their wallet
    
2.  People can buy a lottery ticket. When you buy a lottery ticket, the computer takes the money you give to it and multiplies it by 2.5
	- This means that the computer now adds that multiplied value to your wallet value, which means that by buying a ticket, you won’t ever be able to spend that coin increase your chances of winning
