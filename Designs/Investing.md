## Investing Design 

### Staking
> Bank functionality
> - WC is put into contract (staked) until removed
> - based on amount of WC transacted in the past 24h, the staked WC either gains or loses X% value
>   - staked WC gains/loses the % change of transactions from the previous day
>     - ex 1: if Tuesday's transactions were 1% greater than Monday's transactions, WC stake increases by 1%
>     - ex 2: if Tuesday's transactions were 5% less than Monday's transactions, WC stake decreses by 5%
> - if money is withdrawn within 2 weeks of initially staking it, then 1/3 of the money is burned

> 
> Provide 10% staked value as liquidity (percentage is flexible)
> - "If you stake the coin, you get free tokens" - Audrey Yang
> - ^ I don't know what this means...
> 
> - When you stake the coin you get some other token that signifies the stake and can be redeemed for the staked amount?
> - ^ this was a design suggested in class to incentivize users to stake WC (they would get X# extra tokens in their account if they staked some of their WC), but we (Emma and Audrey) think this feature should be removed b/c there is already enough incentive to stake WC b/c of transaction-based interest
