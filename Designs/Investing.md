## Investing Design 

### Staking
> Bank functionality
> - money is put into contract until removed
> - based on amount of WC transacted in the past 24h either gains or loses X% value
> - if money is withdrawn within 2 weeks of initaly placing it in 1/3 of the money is burned
> 
> Provide liquid token while staking
> - "If you stake the coin, you get free tokens" - Audrey Yang
> - ^ I don't know what this means...
> - When you stake the coin you get some other token that signifies the stake and can be redeemed for the staked amount?
