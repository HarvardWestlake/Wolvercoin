# Investing Design 
- People are able to "stake" their money
    - money they have staked is not able to be spent until they take it out
    - similar to depositing your money with a bank
- Each day:
    - depending on amount of Wolvercoin transacted, one of two things occurs: 
        - gain 0.5% interest on the money they staked
        - burns 0.5% of the money they staked 
- people are able to collect their staked money AFTER TWO WEEKS
    - if done before the two week period, 1/3 of staked money is burned 



## Investing Ideas:
- Staking for x amount of time and earn interest
- Each day ppl get 3% interest
- If you stake the coin, you get free tokens
