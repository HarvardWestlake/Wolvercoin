# Auction

- Private goods: [Dutch Auction](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dutchauction.asp)
  - Items go up for sale on Wolvercoin website
  - Immediately after they go up for sale, a "money clock" counts down from the max price to the min price, going down by X $WVC per minute
  - People can press "buy" at any time and immediately get the item at the price displayeed on the clock
  - > possible unique design: one time opportunity for price to go up and for someone else to click and claim the prize/ item
  - Incentivizes people to buy early because they are scared that other people will buy before them if the price goes too low
  - Requested by Andrew Theiss: If price goes below a minimum price set by the publisher, the auction ends and nobody wins. The item can then go back into sale starting at the max price again at a later date
  - (not handled on the blockchain, but by the website) emails are sent out to all students when a new item goes up for sale
- Public goods: Kickstarter model
  - > Public goods: anything that is non excludable and benefits the whole class (e.g. class parties, etc)
  - Public goods are displayed on the Wolvercoin website and there is a set communal price (e.g. 100 $WVC for a party)
  - People chip in their Wolvercoin and if the goal is achieved, the public good gets got
  - Wolvercoin is put into a hold if it is chipped in, but people can take out their contributions at any time, until the goal is achieved, at which point their wolvercoin is actually spent
