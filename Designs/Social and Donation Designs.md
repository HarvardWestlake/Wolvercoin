> ## Social and Donation Designs
> #### Charity
> - 1% of the community pot is dedicated to charity
> - Users can use the voting system to decide which charity is chosen
> - Donations will be made every week
> - It will be converted back to USD before donating

> #### All idea from unedited list: 
> - 1% goes to a community pot and we can vote on how its spent
> - 5% of transactions go to a lottery pool, each change of winning proportional to the WVC they hold in relation to the total supply (so ppl are patient)
> - 10% randomly gets transferred to a random user once a week
> - Welfare service, once a week, lottery account gives whatever amount of money it has to people with less than 10 wolvercoins who sign up for the service
> - 0.05% of wolvercoin is converted back into USD and donated to charity of the classes choice
> - Use Wolvercoin to help Wolverines IRL
> - 5% of the pot from the lottery goes to charity- can vote how itâ€™s spent
