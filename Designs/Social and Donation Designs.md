## Social and Donation Designs

### Charity
> 5% of all transactions are placed in a communal pot
> - The pot is a multisig wallet (wallet with multiple private keys) that is controlled by a board of elected officials (see voting and representation)
> - Officials are elected at the begining of every school year
> 
> Active students and alumni who still have coins can vote on both the elected officials and where the money will go


### Donations
> Donations made on a monthly basis in either NFTs or USD 
> !!how would they donate an NFT and what would the purpose be
> Ballot of potential charities is set by board members in the form of wallets for each charity but voting is done by users
