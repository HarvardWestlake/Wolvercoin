## Social and Donation Designs

### Charity
> 5% of all transactions are placed in a communal pot
> - The pot is a multisig wallet different from a user's personal wallet that has 3 private keys. The multisig wallet is controlled by a board of 3 elected officials (see voting and representation)
> - Officials are elected on August 30th by a public poll where students actively taking Honors Topics can choose three of their peers to elect to the board.
> 


### Donations
> Donations from the pot are made on a monthly basis in either NFTs or USD 
> !!how would they donate an NFT and what would the purpose be
> Ballot of potential charities is set by board members
> Active students and alumni who still have coins can vote on this ballot to determine where the money will go
> The Board will create a public wallet designated to whichever charity wins
> Board members have access to the wallet so they can convert to USD to donate it
