> ## Exclusivity
> #### Honors Topics People can do a class wide majority vote to run any WolverCoin function with any parameters or change any part of the WolverCoin code
> - Mr. Theiss gets max 15% of total vote worth of weight in his vote- but he can choose to let his vote weigh as less as he wants
> #### Only Honors topics students can have WolverCoin at full functionality
> - Only Honors topics students can fully withdraw Wolvercoin after investing, if theyâ€™re not in topics, half their withdrawal money gets stolen for the lottery pot, and only gets back the other half.
> - If Ricky C ever makes an account, invests in WolverCoin, and tries to withdraw, he only gets 5% back and the rest goes to the lottery pot, and with that return transaction, gets a message "enjoy your joyful pursuit of excellence!"
> #### Honors Topics Students can unanimously vote to have a non Honors Topics Student be considered an Honors Topics Student by WolverCoin
> - As such, this student will have all priviliges, including voting priviliges, of an Honors Topics Student (be considered a full fledged Honors Topics Student by WolverCoin)
> #### Honors Topics Students can select a fellow Honors Topics Student, and Honors Topics Students (exluding the selected indiviual) can unanimously vote to excommunicate the selected individual from being considered an Honors Topics Student by WolverCoin
> - this individual will lose all priviliges of an Honors Topics Student (be considered the same as any other non Honors Topics Student by WolverCoin)
> 
> #### All Exclusivity Design Ideas:
> Don't allow people who havent completed honors topics to not withdraw $$$\
> non honors topics get 50% decreased rewards
