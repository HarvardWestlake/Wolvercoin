## Voting and Representation

### DAO
> Each person who holds any amount of VoterCoin has representation in a DAO.
> - DAO is a contract that has authority to change important variable within the contract
> - For example: changing the address of proxy (updates), changing the list of minters (elections), or changing variables (donations)
> 
> VoterCoin - *a voting system for diverse ideas*
>  - Users may propose propositions to spend the money held in the treasury (or do some other thing as described by the DAO structure above)
>  - Users will receive the amount of money they spend in tax and gas as VoterCoin (a second coin)
>  - VoterCoin is staked into a proposition when voting (using a non-FPTP system)
>  - 100 blocks (or some amount of time roughly a week) after a given proposition was proposed, it will be voted on, and if a majority of all VoterCoin currently staked is staked in that proposition, and 20% of all VC in existence is staked in that proposition, it will be passed
>  - If you voted for the winning proposition then 50% of your staked VoterCoins is burnt, and the other 50% is returned to you
>  - If a proposition is not passed then the VoterCoin staked for it is returned in full to the previous owners
>  - You cannot transact VoterCoin

### Multi-Year Fail-safes
> Over time the people who are on the network the longest (Mr. Theiss) will gain more power than new users (students). As such it seems logical to put system into place that allows some people catch up 
> - If this is designed to only have the HW name on it and by used by many people then ignore the following ideas 
> - However, on the other hand if this is meant to be used primarily withing the hTopics class then consider the following 
> 
> The hardest part of this is deciphering who is in the class and who is some random person on the network 
> - Solution: All wallet address must be registered to some system that passes the vote to the DAO (likely consisting of last year's students)
> - On August 30th all of registered users are given an initial amount of coin 
> - On August 29th any users that were registered as students last year are removed by the contract 
> 
> If one person ever has too much control, there is a system to be able to end the coin 
> - if 80% of people on the DAO, excluding the top 3 holders of coin, vote to end the network then it is deleted. (likely by causing the proxy to point to an empty account)
