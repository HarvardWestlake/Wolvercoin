# DESIGN: 
- DAO - people that hold voterCoin  
  - People are given voterCoin for the amount of gas they spending
  - voterCoin can be staked to gain voting power (in a non-FTP voting system)
    - If you voted for the winning proposition then your staked voterCoins is burned
    - If you voted for the losing proposition then your staked voterCoins is return
    - This should hopefully mean many different ideas can be pass 
  - Removed: 2 types of voting (each with own requirements to be able to vote) for different scenarios
  - Removed: Restricted voting: 2nd type of token, allows people to use this second token to vote on decisions
  - Removed: Only people with possession of this 2nd token can vote in these types of decisions
  - Removed: Open voting: DAO made up of current Honors Topics students with any amount of Wolvercoin over 0 wolvercoin
  - Removed: Weighted voting: people who are eligible to vote have more weight on the vote depending on how much theyâ€™ve spent (maxed at a certain spent amount) 
- voterCoin
  - For each transaction, the user gets a certain amount of a VOTE coin which increases based on how much the user spent in their transaction.
  - These SPENT coins determine the amount of votes a user receives when determining how the community pot is spent.
- Failsafes
  - At the start of the year their is some function that can determin who is in the honors topics class
  - On August 30th (or any similar date) all of them are given an initial amount of coin
  - On June 30th (or any similar date) the amount of coin they origonally got is removed 
  - If one person every has too much control, there is a system to be able to end the coin
    - if 80% of people (excluding the top 5 holders) vote to end the coin then the proxy that the code uses is pointed to nothing (deleteiung the coin)
