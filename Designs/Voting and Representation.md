## Voting and Representation

### DAO
> Each person who holds any amount of VoterCoin has representation in a DAO.
> - DAO is a contract that has authority to change important variable within the contract
> - For example: changing the address of proxy (updates), changing the list of minters (elections), or changing variables (donations)
> 
> VoterCoin - *a voting system for diverse ideas*
>  -  For money burnt as part of WC transaction, mints part of that back to user in VoterCoin
>  - VoterCoin is staked when voting (using a non-FPTP system)
>  - If you voted for the winning proposition then your staked VoterCoins is burnt
>  - If you voted for one of the losing proposition then some percentage of the staked VoterCoins is returned
>  - If no consensus is reached then (most of) the staked VoterCoin is sent to some communal fund

### Multi-Year Fail-safes
> Over time the people who are on the network the longest (Mr. Theiss) will gain more power than new users (students). As such it seems logical to put system into place that allows some people catch up 
> - If this is designed to only have the HW name on it and by used by many people then ignore  the following ideas 
> - However, on the other hand if this is meant to be used primarily withing the hTopics class then consider the following 
> 
> The hardest part of this is deciphering who is in the class and who is some random person on the network 
> - Solution: All wallet address must be registered to some system that passes the vote to the DAO (likely consisting of last year's students)
> - On August 30th all of registered users are given an initial amount of coin 
> - On August 29th any users that were registered as students last year are removed by the contract 
> 
> If one person ever has too much control, there is a system to be able to end the coin 
> - if 80% of people on the DAO, excluding the top 3 holders of coin, vote to end the network then it is deleted. (likely by causing the proxy to point to an empty account)
