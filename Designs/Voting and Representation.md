## Voting and Representation

### DAO
> Each person who holds any amount of VoterCoin has representation in a DAO.
> - DAO is a contract that has authority to change important variable within the contract
> - For example: changing the address of proxy (updates), changing the list of minters or administrators as may be defined elsewhere but whose existence is not to be inferred solely by their mention here (elections), or changing variables (donations)
> 
> VoterCoin - *a voting system for diverse ideas*
>  - Users may propose propositions to spend the money held in the treasury (or do some other thing such as appoint a new administrator as described by the DAO structure above)
>  - Users will receive the amount of money they spend in tax and gas in Wolvercoin as VoterCoin (a second coin, abbreviated VC)
>  - VoterCoin is staked into a proposition when voting (using a non-FPTP system). A given VC or part thereof may only be staked into one proposition at a time. (If account X has 5 VC, they can stake 3 VC in proposition A and 2 VC in propisition B, but then cannot stake any more in any other propositions unless they withdraw their stake)
>  - 100 blocks (or some amount of time roughly a week) after a given proposition was proposed, it will be voted on, and if a majority of all VoterCoin currently staked is staked in that proposition, and 20% of all VC in existence is staked in that proposition, it will be passed
>  - If you voted for the winning proposition then 50% of your staked VoterCoins is burnt (destroyed), and the other 50% is returned to you
>  - If a proposition is not passed then the VoterCoin staked for it is returned in full to the previous owners
>  - You cannot transact VoterCoin between accounts

### Single-Year Fail-safes
> - Via a proposition as described above, an administrator or multiple administrators may be appointed, who may unilaterally shut down the network in case of emergency and may otherwise commit drastic action like altering variables to save the network in times of acute trouble
> - The exact powers of such adminstrators will be defined in the proposition
> - Multiple different types of administrators called different things with different responsibilities may be defined by the proposition
> - No administrator may alter the structure of the DAO
> - The structure of the DAO (the things defined on this document) may only be altered by a proposition which attains 75% of all extant VC (not just of all staked VC)
>  - The top three holders of Wolvercoin will be excluded from staking VC, and their VC will not be counted when ascertaining if 75% of all extant VC has been staked

### Multi-Year Fail-safes
> Over time the people who are on the network the longest (Mr. Theiss) will gain more power than new users (students). As such it seems logical to put system into place that allows some people catch up 
> - If this is designed to only have the HW name on it and by used by many people then ignore the following ideas 
> - However, on the other hand if this is meant to be used primarily withing the hTopics class then consider the following 
> 
> The hardest part of this is deciphering who is in the class and who is some random person on the network 
> - Solution: All wallet address must be registered to some system that is approved via a vote of the DAO (likely consisting of last year's students) through a proposition as described above
> - On August 30th all of registered users are given an initial amount of coin 
> - On August 29th any users that were registered as students last year are removed by the contract 
> 
> If one person ever has too much control, there is a system to be able to end the coin 
> - if 80% of people on the DAO, excluding the top 3 holders of coin, vote to end the network then it is deleted. (likely by causing the proxy to point to an empty account)
