##Voting/Representation:
#UNFILTERED FROM LIST: 
- If > 69% of people vote to destroy Wolvercoin then it will be destroyed
 -> Create a second token that gives governing power (like Bone in ShibeCoin to allow people to vote)
- Have a DAO to vote on proposals
- if someone controls 20%, inflate the supply of wolvercoin to dilute them to %15
- 1% goes to a community pot and we can vote on how it's spent
- ((((votes are proportional to coin SPENT not coin HELD*** -> encourage spending 

DESIGN: DAO - all the people/ group that can vote (people that hold wolvercoin)  
- 2 types of voting (each with own requirements to be able to vote) for different scenarios
 -> Restricted voting: 2nd type of token, allows people to use this second token to vote on decisions
   -> Only people with possession of this 2nd token can vote in these types of decisions
 -> Open voting: DAO made up of current Honors Topics students with any amount of Wolvercoin over 0 wolvercoin
   -> Weighted voting: people who are eligible to vote have more weight on the vote depending on how much theyâ€™ve spent (maxed at a certain spent amount) 
- 2nd coin
 -> For each transaction, the user gets a certain amount of a VOTE coin which increases based on how much the user spent in their transaction.
 -> These SPENT coins determine the amount of votes a user receives when determining how the community pot is spent.
