#Technical Specification for Exclusivity 
> **Function 1 (INCOMPLETE): 
> - each person is allowed to deposit one coin into a designated address as a vote (people can use the deposit method?)
> - count number of coins
> - allow Mr. Theiss to deposit up to 15% of that number of coins -- use an if statement to prevent him from depositing more (? -- this should probably be changed)
> - if percentage of number of coins deposited / number of people in class > 50% -> allow the initiative to pass
> - Variables:
> - sum: counts number of coins in the designated address
> - percentage: percentage of number of coins deposited / number of people in class
> return a boolean of true or false depending on if the initiative passes
> clear the designated address
> should we create a separate coin for voting? or just use Wolvercoin?
