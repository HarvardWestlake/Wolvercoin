- Create a HashSet (alumniSet) that stores the names (public key) of every Honors Topic graduate/alum
- Create an addAlumni method with no parameters
	- If a Wolvercoin user is an alum, add to alumniSet and mint them an NFT by calling NFT method
- Add a parameter to the stake method that takes in a String userKey (public key)
	- Add an assertion statement to the stake method
		- assert that alumniSet contains userName, allowing them to proceed and stake their Wolvercoin
		- If HashSet does not contain userName, subsequent code will not run
